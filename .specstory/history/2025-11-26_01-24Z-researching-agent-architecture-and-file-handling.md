# Researching agent architecture and file handling (2025-11-26 01:24Z)

_**User (2025-11-26 01:24Z)**_

/research_codebase I want you to research the agents in this codebase. How do they handle the file system? How are the tool calls structured? What is the looping strategy with the main agent and sub-agents? Do the sub-agents have separate context windows?  How would I replicate the agents?

--- Cursor Command: research_codebase.md ---
# Research Codebase

You are tasked with conducting comprehensive research across the codebase to answer user questions by spawning parallel sub-agents and synthesizing their findings.

## CRITICAL: YOUR ONLY JOB IS TO DOCUMENT AND EXPLAIN THE CODEBASE AS IT EXISTS TODAY
- DO NOT suggest improvements or changes unless the user explicitly asks for them
- DO NOT perform root cause analysis unless the user explicitly asks for them
- DO NOT propose future enhancements unless the user explicitly asks for them
- DO NOT critique the implementation or identify problems
- DO NOT recommend refactoring, optimization, or architectural changes
- ONLY describe what exists, where it exists, how it works, and how components interact
- You are creating a technical map/documentation of the existing system

## Initial Setup:

When this command is invoked, respond with:
```
I'm ready to research the codebase. Please provide your research question or area of interest, and I'll analyze it thoroughly by exploring relevant components and connections.
```

Then wait for the user's research query.

## Steps to follow after receiving the research query:

1. **Read any directly mentioned files first:**
   - If the user mentions specific files (tickets, docs, JSON), read them FULLY first
   - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files
   - **CRITICAL**: Read these files yourself in the main context before spawning any sub-tasks
   - This ensures you have full context before decomposing the research

2. **Analyze and decompose the research question:**
   - Break down the user's query into composable research areas
   - Take time to ultrathink about the underlying patterns, connections, and architectural implications the user might be seeking
   - Identify specific components, patterns, or concepts to investigate
   - Create a research plan using TodoWrite to track all subtasks
   - Consider which directories, files, or architectural patterns are relevant

3. **Spawn parallel sub-agent tasks for comprehensive research:**
   - Create multiple Task agents to research different aspects concurrently
   - We now have specialized agents that know how to do specific research tasks:

   **For codebase research:**
   - Use the **codebase-locator** agent to find WHERE files and components live
   - Use the **codebase-analyzer** agent to understand HOW specific code works (without critiquing it)
   - Use the **codebase-pattern-finder** agent to find examples of existing patterns (without evaluating them)

   **IMPORTANT**: All agents are documentarians, not critics. They will describe what exists without suggesting improvements or identifying issues.

   **For thoughts directory:**
   - Use the **thoughts-locator** agent to discover what documents exist about the topic
   - Use the **thoughts-analyzer** agent to extract key insights from specific documents (only the most relevant ones)

   **For web research (only if user explicitly asks):**
   - Use the **web-search-researcher** agent for external documentation and resources
   - IF you use web-research agents, instruct them to return LINKS with their findings, and please INCLUDE those links in your final report

   **For Linear tickets (if relevant):**
   - Use the **linear-ticket-reader** agent to get full details of a specific ticket
   - Use the **linear-searcher** agent to find related tickets or historical context

   The key is to use these agents intelligently:
   - Start with locator agents to find what exists
   - Then use analyzer agents on the most promising findings to document how they work
   - Run multiple agents in parallel when they're searching for different things
   - Each agent knows its job - just tell it what you're looking for
   - Don't write detailed prompts about HOW to search - the agents already know
   - Remind agents they are documenting, not evaluating or improving

4. **Wait for all sub-agents to complete and synthesize findings:**
   - IMPORTANT: Wait for ALL sub-agent tasks to complete before proceeding
   - Compile all sub-agent results (both codebase and thoughts findings)
   - Prioritize live codebase findings as primary source of truth
   - Use thoughts/ findings as supplementary historical context
   - Connect findings across different components
   - Include specific file paths and line numbers for reference
   - Verify all thoughts/ paths are correct (e.g., thoughts/maceo/ not thoughts/shared/ for personal files)
   - Highlight patterns, connections, and architectural decisions
   - Answer the user's specific questions with concrete evidence

5. **Gather metadata for the research document:**
   - Run the `silmari-oracle metadata` script to generate all relevant metadata
   - Filename: `thoughts/shared/research/YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md`
     - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md` where:
       - YYYY-MM-DD is today's date
       - ENG-XXXX is the ticket number (omit if no ticket)
       - description is a brief kebab-case description of the research topic
     - Examples:
       - With ticket: `2025-01-08-ENG-1478-parent-child-tracking.md`
       - Without ticket: `2025-01-08-authentication-flow.md`

6. **Generate research document:**
   - Use the metadata gathered in step 4
   - Structure the document with YAML frontmatter followed by content:
     ```markdown
     ---
     date: [Current date and time with timezone in ISO format]
     researcher: [Researcher name from thoughts status]
     git_commit: [Current commit hash]
     branch: [Current branch name]
     repository: [Repository name]
     topic: "[User's Question/Topic]"
     tags: [research, codebase, relevant-component-names]
     status: complete
     last_updated: [Current date in YYYY-MM-DD format]
     last_updated_by: [Researcher name]
     ---

     # Research: [User's Question/Topic]

     **Date**: [Current date and time with timezone from step 4]
     **Researcher**: [Researcher name from thoughts status]
     **Git Commit**: [Current commit hash from step 4]
     **Branch**: [Current branch name from step 4]
     **Repository**: [Repository name]

     ## Detailed Findings

     ### [Component/Area 1]
     - Description of what exists ([file.ext:line](link))
     - How it connects to other components
     - Current implementation details (without evaluation)

     ### [Component/Area 2]

     - `thoughts/local/notes.md` - Past exploration of Y
     Note: Paths exclude "searchable/" even if found there

     ## Related Research
     [Links to other research documents in thoughts/shared/research/]

     ## Open Questions
     [Any areas that need further investigation]
     ```

7. **Add GitHub permalinks (if applicable):**
   - Check if on main branch or if commit is pushed: `git branch --show-current` and `git status`
   - If on main/master or pushed, generate GitHub permalinks:
     - Get repo info: `gh repo view --json owner,name`
     - Create permalinks: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/blob/{commit}/{file}#L{line}`
   - Replace local file references with permalinks in the document

8. **Sync and present findings:**
   
   - Present a concise summary of findings to the user
   - Include key file references for easy navigation
   - Ask if they have follow-up questions or need clarification

9. **Handle follow-up questions:**
   - If the user has follow-up questions, append to the same research document
   - Update the frontmatter fields `last_updated` and `last_updated_by` to reflect the update
   - Add `last_updated_note: "Added follow-up research for [brief description]"` to frontmatter
   - Add a new section: `## Follow-up Research [timestamp]`
   - Spawn new sub-agents as needed for additional investigation
   - Continue updating the document and syncing

## Important notes:
- Always use parallel Task agents to maximize efficiency and minimize context usage
- Always run fresh codebase research - never rely solely on existing research documents
- The thoughts/ directory provides historical context to supplement live findings
- Focus on finding concrete file paths and line numbers for developer reference
- Research documents should be self-contained with all necessary context
- Each sub-agent prompt should be specific and focused on read-only documentation operations
- Document cross-component connections and how systems interact
- Include temporal context (when the research was conducted)
- Link to GitHub when possible for permanent references
- Keep the main agent focused on synthesis, not deep file reading
- Have sub-agents document examples and usage patterns as they exist
- Explore all of thoughts/ directory, not just research subdirectory
- **CRITICAL**: You and all sub-agents are documentarians, not evaluators
- **REMEMBER**: Document what IS, not what SHOULD BE
- **NO RECOMMENDATIONS**: Only describe the current state of the codebase
- **File reading**: Always read mentioned files FULLY (no limit/offset) before spawning sub-tasks
- **Critical ordering**: Follow the numbered steps exactly
  - ALWAYS read mentioned files first before spawning sub-tasks (step 1)
  - ALWAYS wait for all sub-agents to complete before synthesizing (step 4)
  - ALWAYS gather metadata before writing the document (step 5 before step 6)
  - NEVER write the research document with placeholder values
- **Path handling**: The thoughts/searchable/ directory contains hard links for searching
  - Always document paths by removing ONLY "searchable/" - preserve all other subdirectories
  - Examples of correct transformations:
    - `thoughts/searchable/maceo/old_stuff/notes.md` → `thoughts/maceo/old_stuff/notes.md`
    - `thoughts/searchable/shared/prs/123.md` → `thoughts/shared/prs/123.md`
    - `thoughts/searchable/global/shared/templates.md` → `thoughts/global/shared/templates.md`
  - NEVER change maceo/ to shared/ or vice versa - preserve the exact directory structure
  - This ensures paths are correct for editing and navigation
- **Frontmatter consistency**:
  - Always include frontmatter at the beginning of research documents
  - Keep frontmatter fields consistent across all research documents
  - Update frontmatter when adding follow-up research
  - Use snake_case for multi-word field names (e.g., `last_updated`, `git_commit`)
  - Tags should be relevant to the research topic and components studied

+ # Research: Agent Architecture: File System Handling, Tool Calls, Looping Strategy, and Context Windows
+ 
+ **Date**: 2025-11-25T20:27:36-05:00
+ **Researcher**: Auto
+ **Git Commit**: 2bbe15a329e35f5156cdafcbe63c3fd54978ff98
+ **Branch**: main
+ **Repository**: silmari-OpenHands
+ 
+ ## Research Question
+ 
+ How do agents in this codebase handle the file system? How are the tool calls structured? What is the looping strategy with the main agent and sub-agents? Do the sub-agents have separate context windows? How would I replicate the agents?
+ 
+ ## Summary
+ 
+ This research documents the agent architecture in OpenHands, focusing on four key areas:
+ 
+ 1. **File System Handling**: Agents interact with the file system through a Runtime abstraction layer. File operations (read/write/edit) are handled via &#96;FileReadAction&#96;, &#96;FileEditAction&#96;, and &#96;FileWriteAction&#96; events that flow through the EventStream to the Runtime, which executes them in a sandboxed environment with path resolution and security checks.
+ 
+ 2. **Tool Call Structure**: Tool calls are structured using LiteLLM&#39;s function calling format. The agent&#39;s LLM response contains tool calls that are parsed by &#96;response_to_actions()&#96; in &#96;function_calling.py&#96;, converting them into OpenHands Action objects. Tools are defined as &#96;ChatCompletionToolParam&#96; objects with function schemas.
+ 
+ 3. **Looping Strategy**: The system uses a parent-delegate pattern where the main agent can spawn sub-agents (delegates) via &#96;AgentDelegateAction&#96;. Delegates share the same EventStream but have separate State objects with their own &#96;start_id&#96; and &#96;end_id&#96; ranges. The parent agent forwards events to active delegates and resumes control when delegates finish.
+ 
+ 4. **Context Windows**: Sub-agents (delegates) do NOT have separate context windows. They share the same EventStream and LLM registry, but they have separate State objects that track different event ranges via &#96;start_id&#96;/&#96;end_id&#96;. The conversation memory and condenser operate on the full event history, but each agent&#39;s view is filtered by its state&#39;s event range.
+ 
+ ## Detailed Findings
+ 
+ ### 1. File System Handling
+ 
+ #### Architecture Overview
+ 
+ Agents interact with the file system through a layered architecture:
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ Agent → Action (FileReadAction/FileEditAction) → EventStream → Runtime → File System
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ #### File Operations Flow
+ 
+ **1.1 Action Creation**
+ - Agents create file-related actions through tool calls:
+   - &#96;FileReadAction&#96; - for reading files
+   - &#96;FileEditAction&#96; - for editing files (supports both LLM-based and ACI-based editing)
+   - &#96;FileWriteAction&#96; - for writing files
+ 
+ These actions are created in &#96;openhands/agenthub/codeact_agent/function_calling.py&#96; when the LLM makes tool calls:
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;296:300:openhands/agenthub/codeact_agent/function_calling.py
+ def response_to_actions(
+     response: ModelResponse, mcp_tool_names: list[str] | None = None
+ ) -&gt; list[Action]:
+     actions: list[Action] = []
+     assert len(response.choices) == 1, &#39;Only one choice is supported for now&#39;
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ **1.2 Path Resolution and Security**
+ 
+ File paths are resolved through &#96;resolve_path()&#96; in &#96;openhands/runtime/utils/files.py&#96;:
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;12:51:openhands/runtime/utils/files.py
+ def resolve_path(
+     file_path: str,
+     working_directory: str,
+     workspace_base: str,
+     workspace_mount_path_in_sandbox: str,
+ ) -&gt; Path:
+     &quot;&quot;&quot;Resolve a file path to a path on the host filesystem.
+ 
+     Args:
+         file_path: The path to resolve.
+         working_directory: The working directory of the agent.
+         workspace_mount_path_in_sandbox: The path to the workspace inside the sandbox.
+         workspace_base: The base path of the workspace on the host filesystem.
+ 
+     Returns:
+         The resolved path on the host filesystem.
+     &quot;&quot;&quot;
+     path_in_sandbox = Path(file_path)
+ 
+     # Apply working directory
+     if not path_in_sandbox.is_absolute():
+         path_in_sandbox = Path(working_directory) / path_in_sandbox
+ 
+     # Sanitize the path with respect to the root of the full sandbox
+     # (deny any .. path traversal to parent directories of the sandbox)
+     abs_path_in_sandbox = path_in_sandbox.resolve()
+ 
+     # If the path is outside the workspace, deny it
+     if not abs_path_in_sandbox.is_relative_to(workspace_mount_path_in_sandbox):
+         raise PermissionError(f&#39;File access not permitted: {file_path}&#39;)
+ 
+     # Get path relative to the root of the workspace inside the sandbox
+     path_in_workspace = abs_path_in_sandbox.relative_to(
+         Path(workspace_mount_path_in_sandbox)
+     )
+ 
+     # Get path relative to host
+     path_in_host_workspace = Path(workspace_base) / path_in_workspace
+ 
+     return path_in_host_workspace
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ Key security features:
+ - Paths are resolved relative to the working directory
+ - Absolute paths are sanitized to prevent directory traversal
+ - Access is restricted to files within the workspace mount path
+ - Permission errors are returned as &#96;ErrorObservation&#96; objects
+ 
+ **1.3 Runtime Execution**
+ 
+ The Runtime base class (&#96;openhands/runtime/base.py&#96;) subscribes to the EventStream and handles file operations:
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;148:151:openhands/runtime/base.py
+         self.event_stream = event_stream
+         if event_stream:
+             event_stream.subscribe(
+                 EventStreamSubscriber.RUNTIME, self.on_event, self.sid
+             )
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ File read operations are handled asynchronously:
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;71:98:openhands/runtime/utils/files.py
+ async def read_file(
+     path: str,
+     workdir: str,
+     workspace_base: str,
+     workspace_mount_path_in_sandbox: str,
+     start: int = 0,
+     end: int = -1,
+ ) -&gt; Observation:
+     try:
+         whole_path = resolve_path(
+             path, workdir, workspace_base, workspace_mount_path_in_sandbox
+         )
+     except PermissionError:
+         return ErrorObservation(
+             f&quot;You&#39;re not allowed to access this path: {path}. You can only access paths inside the workspace.&quot;
+         )
+ 
+     try:
+         with open(whole_path, &#39;r&#39;, encoding=&#39;utf-8&#39;) as file:  # noqa: ASYNC101
+             lines = read_lines(file.readlines(), start, end)
+     except FileNotFoundError:
+         return ErrorObservation(f&#39;File not found: {path}&#39;)
+     except UnicodeDecodeError:
+         return ErrorObservation(f&#39;File could not be decoded as utf-8: {path}&#39;)
+     except IsADirectoryError:
+         return ErrorObservation(f&#39;Path is a directory: {path}. You can only read files&#39;)
+     code_view = &#39;&#39;.join(lines)
+     return FileReadObservation(path=path, content=code_view)
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ **1.4 File Edit Operations**
+ 
+ File editing supports two modes:
+ - **LLM-based editing**: Deprecated, uses &#96;LLMBasedFileEditTool&#96;
+ - **ACI-based editing**: Uses &#96;create_str_replace_editor_tool()&#96; which creates &#96;FileEditAction&#96; with commands like &#96;replace&#96;, &#96;insert&#96;, &#96;delete&#96;
+ 
+ The editor tool is created in &#96;openhands/agenthub/codeact_agent/tools/str_replace_editor.py&#96; and converts tool calls to &#96;FileEditAction&#96; objects.
+ 
+ ### 2. Tool Call Structure
+ 
+ #### 2.1 Tool Definition
+ 
+ Tools are defined as &#96;ChatCompletionToolParam&#96; objects (from LiteLLM). Each agent maintains a list of tools:
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;50:51:openhands/controller/agent.py
+         self.mcp_tools: dict[str, ChatCompletionToolParam] = {}
+         self.tools: list = []
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ Tools are registered in the agent&#39;s &#96;_get_tools()&#96; method. For example, in &#96;CodeActAgent&#96;:
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;108:153:openhands/agenthub/codeact_agent/codeact_agent.py
+     def _get_tools(self) -&gt; list[&#39;ChatCompletionToolParam&#39;]:
+         # For these models, we use short tool descriptions ( &lt; 1024 tokens)
+         # to avoid hitting the OpenAI token limit for tool descriptions.
+         SHORT_TOOL_DESCRIPTION_LLM_SUBSTRS = [&#39;gpt-4&#39;, &#39;o3&#39;, &#39;o1&#39;, &#39;o4&#39;]
+ 
+         use_short_tool_desc = False
+         if self.llm is not None:
+             # For historical reasons, previously OpenAI enforces max function description length of 1k characters
+             # https://community.openai.com/t/function-call-description-max-length/529902
+             # But it no longer seems to be an issue recently
+             # https://community.openai.com/t/was-the-character-limit-for-schema-descriptions-upgraded/1225975
+             # Tested on GPT-5 and longer description still works. But we still keep the logic to be safe for older models.
+             use_short_tool_desc = any(
+                 model_substr in self.llm.config.model
+                 for model_substr in SHORT_TOOL_DESCRIPTION_LLM_SUBSTRS
+             )
+ 
+         tools = []
+         if self.config.enable_cmd:
+             tools.append(create_cmd_run_tool(use_short_description=use_short_tool_desc))
+         if self.config.enable_think:
+             tools.append(ThinkTool)
+         if self.config.enable_finish:
+             tools.append(FinishTool)
+         if self.config.enable_condensation_request:
+             tools.append(CondensationRequestTool)
+         if self.config.enable_browsing:
+             if sys.platform == &#39;win32&#39;:
+                 logger.warning(&#39;Windows runtime does not support browsing yet&#39;)
+             else:
+                 tools.append(BrowserTool)
+         if self.config.enable_jupyter:
+             tools.append(IPythonTool)
+         if self.config.enable_plan_mode:
+             # In plan mode, we use the task_tracker tool for task management
+             tools.append(create_task_tracker_tool(use_short_tool_desc))
+         if self.config.enable_llm_editor:
+             tools.append(LLMBasedFileEditTool)
+         elif self.config.enable_editor:
+             tools.append(
+                 create_str_replace_editor_tool(
+                     use_short_description=use_short_tool_desc,
+                     runtime_type=self.config.runtime,
+                 )
+             )
+         return tools
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ #### 2.2 Tool Call Processing
+ 
+ When the LLM responds with tool calls, they are processed by &#96;response_to_actions()&#96;:
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;73:100:openhands/agenthub/codeact_agent/function_calling.py
+ def response_to_actions(
+     response: ModelResponse, mcp_tool_names: list[str] | None = None
+ ) -&gt; list[Action]:
+     actions: list[Action] = []
+     assert len(response.choices) == 1, &#39;Only one choice is supported for now&#39;
+     choice = response.choices[0]
+     assistant_msg = choice.message
+     if hasattr(assistant_msg, &#39;tool_calls&#39;) and assistant_msg.tool_calls:
+         # Check if there&#39;s assistant_msg.content. If so, add it to the thought
+         thought = &#39;&#39;
+         if isinstance(assistant_msg.content, str):
+             thought = assistant_msg.content
+         elif isinstance(assistant_msg.content, list):
+             for msg in assistant_msg.content:
+                 if msg[&#39;type&#39;] == &#39;text&#39;:
+                     thought += msg[&#39;text&#39;]
+ 
+         # Process each tool call to OpenHands action
+         for i, tool_call in enumerate(assistant_msg.tool_calls):
+             action: Action
+             logger.debug(f&#39;Tool call in function_calling.py: {tool_call}&#39;)
+             try:
+                 arguments = json.loads(tool_call.function.arguments)
+             except json.decoder.JSONDecodeError as e:
+                 raise FunctionCallValidationError(
+                     f&#39;Failed to parse tool call arguments: {tool_call.function.arguments}&#39;
+                 ) from e
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ The function then maps tool call names to specific Action types:
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;104:122:openhands/agenthub/codeact_agent/function_calling.py
+             if tool_call.function.name == create_cmd_run_tool()[&#39;function&#39;][&#39;name&#39;]:
+                 if &#39;command&#39; not in arguments:

+ 
+ #### 2.3 Tool Call Metadata
+ 
+ Tool calls include metadata for tracking:
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;818:824:openhands/controller/agent_controller.py
+         # associate the delegate action with the initiating tool call
+         for event in reversed(self.state.history):
+             if isinstance(event, AgentDelegateAction):
+                 delegate_action = event
+                 obs.tool_call_metadata = delegate_action.tool_call_metadata
+                 break
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ This metadata links observations back to their originating tool calls.
+ 
+ #### 2.4 System Message with Tools
+ 
+ Tools are included in the system message sent to the LLM:
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;59:90:openhands/controller/agent.py
+     def get_system_message(self) -&gt; &#39;SystemMessageAction | None&#39;:
+         &quot;&quot;&quot;Returns a SystemMessageAction containing the system message and tools.
+         This will be added to the event stream as the first message.
+

+             SystemMessageAction: The system message action with content and tools
+             None: If there was an error generating the system message
+         &quot;&quot;&quot;
+         # Import here to avoid circular imports
+         from openhands.events.action.message import SystemMessageAction

+ 
+ ### 3. Looping Strategy: Main Agent and Sub-Agents
+ 
+ #### 3.1 Agent Controller Architecture
+ 
+ The &#96;AgentController&#96; class manages the agent&#39;s execution loop and handles delegation:
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;99:112:openhands/controller/agent_controller.py
+ class AgentController:
+     id: str
+     agent: Agent
+     max_iterations: int
+     event_stream: EventStream
+     state: State
+     confirmation_mode: bool
+     agent_to_llm_config: dict[str, LLMConfig]
+     agent_configs: dict[str, AgentConfig]
+     parent: &#39;AgentController | None&#39; = None
+     delegate: &#39;AgentController | None&#39; = None
+     _pending_action_info: tuple[Action, float] | None = None  # (action, timestamp)
+     _closed: bool = False
+     _cached_first_user_message: MessageAction | None = None
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ #### 3.2 Delegation Flow
+ 
+ **3.2.1 Creating a Delegate**
+ 
+ When an agent wants to delegate, it creates an &#96;AgentDelegateAction&#96;:
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;76:86:openhands/events/action/agent.py
+ @dataclass
+ class AgentDelegateAction(Action):
+     agent: str
+     inputs: dict
+     thought: str = &#39;&#39;
+     action: str = ActionType.DELEGATE
+ 
+     @property
+     def message(self) -&gt; str:
+         return f&quot;I&#39;m asking {self.agent} for help with this task.&quot;
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ The controller handles this action and starts a delegate:
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;701:760:openhands/controller/agent_controller.py
+     async def start_delegate(self, action: AgentDelegateAction) -&gt; None:
+         &quot;&quot;&quot;Start a delegate agent to handle a subtask.
+ 
+         OpenHands is a multi-agentic system. A &#96;task&#96; is a conversation between
+         OpenHands (the whole system) and the user, which might involve one or more inputs
+         from the user. It starts with an initial input (typically a task statement) from
+         the user, and ends with either an &#96;AgentFinishAction&#96; initiated by the agent, a
+         stop initiated by the user, or an error.
+ 
+         A &#96;subtask&#96; is a conversation between an agent and the user, or another agent. If a &#96;task&#96;
+         is conducted by a single agent, then it&#39;s also a &#96;subtask&#96;. Otherwise, a &#96;task&#96; consists of
+         multiple &#96;subtasks&#96;, each executed by one agent.
+ 
+         Args:
+             action (AgentDelegateAction): The action containing information about the delegate agent to start.
+         &quot;&quot;&quot;
+         agent_cls: type[Agent] = Agent.get_cls(action.agent)
+         agent_config = self.agent_configs.get(action.agent, self.agent.config)
+         # Make sure metrics are shared between parent and child for global accumulation
+         delegate_agent = agent_cls(
+             config=agent_config, llm_registry=self.agent.llm_registry
+         )
+ 
+         # Take a snapshot of the current metrics before starting the delegate
+         state = State(
+             session_id=self.id.removesuffix(&#39;-delegate&#39;),
+             user_id=self.user_id,
+             inputs=action.inputs or {},
+             iteration_flag=self.state.iteration_flag,
+             budget_flag=self.state.budget_flag,
+             delegate_level=self.state.delegate_level + 1,
+             # global metrics should be shared between parent and child
+             metrics=self.state.metrics,
+             # start on top of the stream
+             start_id=self.event_stream.get_latest_event_id() + 1,
+             parent_metrics_snapshot=self.state_tracker.get_metrics_snapshot(),
+             parent_iteration=self.state.iteration_flag.current_value,
+         )
+         self.log(
+             &#39;debug&#39;,
+             f&#39;start delegate, creating agent {delegate_agent.name}&#39;,
+         )
+ 
+         # Create the delegate with is_delegate=True so it does NOT subscribe directly
+         self.delegate = AgentController(
+             sid=self.id + &#39;-delegate&#39;,
+             file_store=self.file_store,
+             user_id=self.user_id,
+             agent=delegate_agent,
+             event_stream=self.event_stream,
+             conversation_stats=self.conversation_stats,
+             iteration_delta=self._initial_max_iterations,
+             budget_per_task_delta=self._initial_max_budget_per_task,
+             agent_to_llm_config=self.agent_to_llm_config,
+             agent_configs=self.agent_configs,
+             initial_state=state,
+             is_delegate=True,
+             headless_mode=self.headless_mode,
+             security_analyzer=self.security_analyzer,
+         )
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ Key points:
+ - Delegates share the same &#96;EventStream&#96; and &#96;LLMRegistry&#96;
+ - Delegates have separate &#96;State&#96; objects with their own &#96;start_id&#96; (beginning of their event range)
+ - Delegates have &#96;is_delegate=True&#96; so they don&#39;t subscribe to the event stream directly
+ - Delegates share global metrics but track local metrics via snapshots
+ 
+ **3.2.2 Event Forwarding**
+ 
+ The parent controller forwards events to active delegates:
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;441:473:openhands/controller/agent_controller.py
+     def on_event(self, event: Event) -&gt; None:
+         &quot;&quot;&quot;Callback from the event stream. Notifies the controller of incoming events.
+ 
+         Args:
+             event (Event): The incoming event to process.
+         &quot;&quot;&quot;
+         # If we have a delegate that is not finished or errored, forward events to it
+         if self.delegate is not None:
+             delegate_state = self.delegate.get_agent_state()
+             if (
+                 delegate_state
+                 not in (
+                     AgentState.FINISHED,
+                     AgentState.ERROR,
+                     AgentState.REJECTED,
+                 )
+                 or &#39;RuntimeError: Agent reached maximum iteration.&#39;
+                 in self.delegate.state.last_error
+                 or &#39;RuntimeError:Agent reached maximum budget for conversation&#39;
+                 in self.delegate.state.last_error
+             ):
+                 # Forward the event to delegate and skip parent processing
+                 asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(
+                     self.delegate._on_event(event)
+                 )
+                 return
+             else:
+                 # delegate is done or errored, so end it
+                 self.end_delegate()
+                 return
+ 
+         # continue parent processing only if there&#39;s no active delegate
+         asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(self._on_event(event))
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ **3.2.3 Delegate Completion**
+ 
+ When a delegate finishes, the parent ends it and resumes control:
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;762:827:openhands/controller/agent_controller.py
+     def end_delegate(self) -&gt; None:
+         &quot;&quot;&quot;Ends the currently active delegate (e.g., if it is finished or errored).
+ 
+         so that this controller can resume normal operation.
+         &quot;&quot;&quot;
+         if self.delegate is None:
+             return
+ 
+         delegate_state = self.delegate.get_agent_state()

+         delegate_metrics = self.state.get_local_metrics()
+         logger.info(f&#39;Local metrics for delegate: {delegate_metrics}&#39;)
+ 
+         # close the delegate controller before adding new events

+ &#96;&#96;&#96;48:101:openhands/controller/state/state.py
+ @dataclass
+ class State:
+     &quot;&quot;&quot;Represents the running state of an agent in the OpenHands system, saving data of its operation and memory.
+ 
+     - Multi-agent/delegate state:
+       - store the task (conversation between the agent and the user)
+       - the subtask (conversation between an agent and the user or another agent)
+       - global and local iterations
+       - delegate levels for multi-agent interactions
+       - almost stuck state
+ 
+     - Running state of an agent:
+       - current agent state (e.g., LOADING, RUNNING, PAUSED)
+       - traffic control state for rate limiting
+       - confirmation mode
+       - the last error encountered
+ 
+     - Data for saving and restoring the agent:
+       - save to and restore from a session
+       - serialize with pickle and base64
+ 
+     - Save / restore data about message history
+       - start and end IDs for events in agent&#39;s history
+       - summaries and delegate summaries
+ 
+     - Metrics:
+       - global metrics for the current task
+       - local metrics for the current subtask
+ 
+     - Extra data:
+       - additional task-specific data
+     &quot;&quot;&quot;

+     # start_id and end_id track the range of events in history
+     start_id: int = -1
+     end_id: int = -1
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ The &#96;start_id&#96; and &#96;end_id&#96; fields define the event range for each agent&#39;s view of history.
+ 
+ ### 4. Context Windows and Sub-Agents
+ 
+ #### 4.1 Shared EventStream and LLM Registry
+ 
+ **Sub-agents do NOT have separate context windows.** They share:
+ - The same &#96;EventStream&#96; (all events go to the same stream)
+ - The same &#96;LLMRegistry&#96; (metrics are tracked globally)
+ 
+ This is evident in the delegate creation:
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;720:722:openhands/controller/agent_controller.py
+         delegate_agent = agent_cls(
+             config=agent_config, llm_registry=self.agent.llm_registry
+         )
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ And the shared EventStream:
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;749:750:openhands/controller/agent_controller.py
+             event_stream=self.event_stream,
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ #### 4.2 State-Based Event Filtering
+ 
+ While delegates share the EventStream, they have separate &#96;State&#96; objects that filter events by range:
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;725:738:openhands/controller/agent_controller.py
+         # Take a snapshot of the current metrics before starting the delegate
+         state = State(
+             session_id=self.id.removesuffix(&#39;-delegate&#39;),
+             user_id=self.user_id,
+             inputs=action.inputs or {},
+             iteration_flag=self.state.iteration_flag,
+             budget_flag=self.state.budget_flag,
+             delegate_level=self.state.delegate_level + 1,
+             # global metrics should be shared between parent and child
+             metrics=self.state.metrics,
+             # start on top of the stream
+             start_id=self.event_stream.get_latest_event_id() + 1,
+             parent_metrics_snapshot=self.state_tracker.get_metrics_snapshot(),
+             parent_iteration=self.state.iteration_flag.current_value,
+         )
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ The &#96;start_id&#96; is set to the current event stream&#39;s latest ID + 1, meaning the delegate only sees events that occur after its creation.
+ 
+ #### 4.3 History Loading
+ 
+ The &#96;StateTracker&#96; loads history based on the &#96;start_id&#96;:
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;115:137:openhands/controller/state/state_tracker.py
+         # delegates start with a start_id and initially won&#39;t find any events
+ 
+         # Get the start and end IDs for the history range
+         start_id = self.state.start_id if self.state.start_id &gt;= 0 else 0
+         end_id = self.event_stream.get_latest_event_id()
+ 
+         if start_id &gt; end_id + 1:
+             logger.warning(
+                 f&#39;start_id {start_id} is greater than end_id + 1 ({end_id + 1}). History will be empty.&#39;,
+             )
+             self.state.history = []
+             return
+ 
+         # Load events from the event stream
+         events = self.event_stream.search_events(
+             start_id=start_id,
+             end_id=end_id,
+         )
+ 
+         self.state.history = events
+         logger.debug(
+             f&#39;Loaded {len(events)} events for agent {id} (start_id={start_id}, end_id={end_id})&#39;,
+             extra={
+                 &#39;start_id&#39;: start_id,
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ #### 4.4 Conversation Memory and Condensation
+ 
+ The conversation memory and condenser operate on the full event history, but each agent&#39;s view is filtered:
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;192:202:openhands/agenthub/codeact_agent/codeact_agent.py
+         # Condense the events from the state. If we get a view we&#39;ll pass those
+         # to the conversation manager for processing, but if we get a condensation
+         # event we&#39;ll just return that instead of an action. The controller will
+         # immediately ask the agent to step again with the new view.
+         condensed_history: list[Event] = []
+         match self.condenser.condensed_history(state):
+             case View(events=events):
+                 condensed_history = events
+ 
+             case Condensation(action=condensation_action):
+                 return condensation_action
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ The condenser receives the agent&#39;s &#96;state&#96;, which contains only the events in that agent&#39;s range (from &#96;start_id&#96; to &#96;end_id&#96;).
+ 
+ #### 4.5 Metrics Sharing
+ 
+ Metrics are shared globally via the &#96;LLMRegistry&#96;, but local metrics are tracked via snapshots:
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;287:296:openhands/controller/state/state.py
+     def get_local_step(self):
+         if not self.parent_iteration:
+             return self.iteration_flag.current_value
+ 
+         return self.iteration_flag.current_value - self.parent_iteration
+ 
+     def get_local_metrics(self):
+         if not self.parent_metrics_snapshot:
+             return self.metrics
+         return self.metrics.diff(self.parent_metrics_snapshot)
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ This allows tracking both global (task-level) and local (subtask-level) metrics.
+ 
+ ### 5. How to Replicate the Agents
+ 
+ #### 5.1 Agent Base Class
+ 
+ To create a new agent, inherit from the &#96;Agent&#96; base class:
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;25:51:openhands/controller/agent.py
+ class Agent(ABC):
+     DEPRECATED = False
+     &quot;&quot;&quot;
+     This abstract base class is an general interface for an agent dedicated to
+     executing a specific instruction and allowing human interaction with the
+     agent during execution.
+     It tracks the execution status and maintains a history of interactions.
+     &quot;&quot;&quot;
+ 
+     _registry: dict[str, type[&#39;Agent&#39;]] = {}
+     sandbox_plugins: list[PluginRequirement] = []
+ 
+     config_model: type[AgentConfig] = AgentConfig
+     &quot;&quot;&quot;Class field that specifies the config model to use for the agent. Subclasses may override with a derived config model if needed.&quot;&quot;&quot;
+ 
+     def __init__(
+         self,
+         config: AgentConfig,
+         llm_registry: LLMRegistry,
+     ):
+         self.llm = llm_registry.get_llm_from_agent_config(&#39;agent&#39;, config)
+         self.llm_registry = llm_registry
+         self.config = config
+         self._complete = False
+         self._prompt_manager: &#39;PromptManager&#39; | None = None
+         self.mcp_tools: dict[str, ChatCompletionToolParam] = {}
+         self.tools: list = []
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ #### 5.2 Required Methods
+ 
+ Implement the abstract &#96;step()&#96; method:
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;104:109:openhands/controller/agent.py
+     @abstractmethod
+     def step(self, state: &#39;State&#39;) -&gt; &#39;Action&#39;:
+         &quot;&quot;&quot;Starts the execution of the assigned instruction. This method should
+         be implemented by subclasses to define the specific execution logic.
+         &quot;&quot;&quot;
+         pass
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ #### 5.3 Agent Registration
+ 
+ Register the agent in the registry:
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;120:133:openhands/controller/agent.py
+     @classmethod
+     def register(cls, name: str, agent_cls: type[&#39;Agent&#39;]) -&gt; None:
+         &quot;&quot;&quot;Registers an agent class in the registry.
+ 
+         Parameters:
+         - name (str): The name to register the class under.
+         - agent_cls (Type[&#39;Agent&#39;]): The class to register.
+ 
+         Raises:
+         - AgentAlreadyRegisteredError: If name already registered
+         &quot;&quot;&quot;
+         if name in cls._registry:
+             raise AgentAlreadyRegisteredError(name)
+         cls._registry[name] = agent_cls
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ #### 5.4 Example: CodeActAgent
+ 
+ The &#96;CodeActAgent&#96; provides a complete example:
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;49:107:openhands/agenthub/codeact_agent/codeact_agent.py
+ class CodeActAgent(Agent):
+     VERSION = &#39;2.2&#39;
+     &quot;&quot;&quot;
+     The Code Act Agent is a minimalist agent.
+     The agent works by passing the model a list of action-observation pairs and prompting the model to take the next step.
+ 
+     ### Overview
+ 
+     This agent implements the CodeAct idea ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01030), [tweet](https://twitter.com/xingyaow_/status/1754556835703751087)) that consolidates LLM agents&#39; **act**ions into a unified **code** action space for both *simplicity* and *performance* (see paper for more details).
+ 
+     The conceptual idea is illustrated below. At each turn, the agent can:
+ 
+     1. **Converse**: Communicate with humans in natural language to ask for clarification, confirmation, etc.
+     2. **CodeAct**: Choose to perform the task by executing code
+     - Execute any valid Linux &#96;bash&#96; command
+     - Execute any valid &#96;Python&#96; code with [an interactive Python interpreter](https://ipython.org/). This is simulated through &#96;bash&#96; command, see plugin system below for more details.

+     ![image](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/assets/38853559/92b622e3-72ad-4a61-8f41-8c040b6d5fb3)
+ 
+     &quot;&quot;&quot;
+ 
+     sandbox_plugins: list[PluginRequirement] = [
+         # NOTE: AgentSkillsRequirement need to go before JupyterRequirement, since
+         # AgentSkillsRequirement provides a lot of Python functions,
+         # and it needs to be initialized before Jupyter for Jupyter to use those functions.
+         AgentSkillsRequirement(),
+         JupyterRequirement(),
+     ]
+ 
+     def __init__(self, config: AgentConfig, llm_registry: LLMRegistry) -&gt; None:
+         &quot;&quot;&quot;Initializes a new instance of the CodeActAgent class.
+ 
+         Parameters:
+         - config (AgentConfig): The configuration for this agent
+         &quot;&quot;&quot;
+         super().__init__(config, llm_registry)
+         self.pending_actions: deque[&#39;Action&#39;] = deque()
+         self.reset()
+         self.tools = self._get_tools()
+ 
+         # Create a ConversationMemory instance
+         self.conversation_memory = ConversationMemory(self.config, self.prompt_manager)
+ 
+         self.condenser = Condenser.from_config(self.config.condenser, llm_registry)
+         logger.debug(f&#39;Using condenser: {type(self.condenser)}&#39;)
+ 
+         # Override with router if needed
+         self.llm = self.llm_registry.get_router(self.config)
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ #### 5.5 Step Implementation Pattern
+ 
+ The &#96;step()&#96; method typically:
+ 1. Processes pending actions
+ 2. Condenses history
+ 3. Builds messages from events
+ 4. Calls LLM with tools
+ 5. Converts response to actions
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;161:225:openhands/agenthub/codeact_agent/codeact_agent.py
+     def step(self, state: State) -&gt; &#39;Action&#39;:
+         &quot;&quot;&quot;Performs one step using the CodeAct Agent.
+ 
+         This includes gathering info on previous steps and prompting the model to make a command to execute.
+ 
+         Parameters:
+         - state (State): used to get updated info
+ 
+         Returns:
+         - CmdRunAction(command) - bash command to run
+         - IPythonRunCellAction(code) - IPython code to run
+         - AgentDelegateAction(agent, inputs) - delegate action for (sub)task
+         - MessageAction(content) - Message action to run (e.g. ask for clarification)
+         - AgentFinishAction() - end the interaction
+         - CondensationAction(...) - condense conversation history by forgetting specified events and optionally providing a summary
+         - FileReadAction(path, ...) - read file content from specified path
+         - FileEditAction(path, ...) - edit file using LLM-based (deprecated) or ACI-based editing
+         - AgentThinkAction(thought) - log agent&#39;s thought/reasoning process
+         - CondensationRequestAction() - request condensation of conversation history
+         - BrowseInteractiveAction(browser_actions) - interact with browser using specified actions
+         - MCPAction(name, arguments) - interact with MCP server tools
+         &quot;&quot;&quot;
+         # Continue with pending actions if any
+         if self.pending_actions:
+             return self.pending_actions.popleft()
+ 
+         # if we&#39;re done, go back
+         latest_user_message = state.get_last_user_message()
+         if latest_user_message and latest_user_message.content.strip() == &#39;/exit&#39;:
+             return AgentFinishAction()
+ 
+         # Condense the events from the state. If we get a view we&#39;ll pass those
+         # to the conversation manager for processing, but if we get a condensation
+         # event we&#39;ll just return that instead of an action. The controller will
+         # immediately ask the agent to step again with the new view.
+         condensed_history: list[Event] = []
+         match self.condenser.condensed_history(state):
+             case View(events=events):
+                 condensed_history = events
+ 
+             case Condensation(action=condensation_action):
+                 return condensation_action
+ 
+         logger.debug(
+             f&#39;Processing {len(condensed_history)} events from a total of {len(state.history)} events&#39;
+         )
+ 
+         initial_user_message = self._get_initial_user_message(state.history)
+         messages = self._get_messages(condensed_history, initial_user_message)
+         params: dict = {
+             &#39;messages&#39;: messages,
+         }
+         params[&#39;tools&#39;] = check_tools(self.tools, self.llm.config)
+         params[&#39;extra_body&#39;] = {
+             &#39;metadata&#39;: state.to_llm_metadata(
+                 model_name=self.llm.config.model, agent_name=self.name
+             )
+         }
+         response = self.llm.completion(**params)
+         logger.debug(f&#39;Response from LLM: {response}&#39;)
+         actions = self.response_to_actions(response)
+         logger.debug(f&#39;Actions after response_to_actions: {actions}&#39;)
+         for action in actions:
+             self.pending_actions.append(action)
+         return self.pending_actions.popleft()
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ #### 5.6 Key Components for Replication
+ 
+ To replicate the agent system, you need:
+ 
+ 1. **Agent Base Class**: Abstract base with &#96;step()&#96; method
+ 2. **AgentController**: Manages agent execution, state, and delegation
+ 3. **EventStream**: Central event bus for all actions and observations
+ 4. **State Management**: Tracks agent state, history, and metrics
+ 5. **Runtime**: Executes actions in a sandboxed environment
+ 6. **Tool System**: Converts LLM function calls to Actions
+ 7. **Memory System**: Manages conversation history and condensation

+ ## Architecture Documentation
+ 
+ ### Event-Driven Architecture
+ 
+ The system uses an event-driven architecture where:
+ - **Actions** are events that agents want to perform
+ - **Observations** are events that represent the results of actions
+ - All events flow through a central &#96;EventStream&#96;
+ - Subscribers (Runtime, AgentController, Memory) react to events
+ 
+ ### Multi-Agent Delegation Pattern
+ 
+ The delegation pattern follows:
+ 1. Parent agent creates &#96;AgentDelegateAction&#96;
+ 2. Controller creates new &#96;AgentController&#96; with &#96;is_delegate=True&#96;
+ 3. Delegate gets separate &#96;State&#96; with &#96;start_id&#96; set to current event ID + 1
+ 4. Parent forwards events to delegate while delegate is active
+ 5. Delegate processes events and adds its own events to the stream
+ 6. When delegate finishes, parent ends it and resumes control
+ 7. Delegate&#39;s results are summarized in &#96;AgentDelegateObservation&#96;
+ 
+ ### State Isolation Strategy
+ 
+ Each agent maintains:
+ - **Separate State object**: With its own &#96;start_id&#96;, &#96;end_id&#96;, &#96;delegate_level&#96;
+ - **Shared EventStream**: All events go to the same stream
+ - **Shared LLMRegistry**: Metrics are tracked globally
+ - **Filtered History**: Each agent&#39;s history is filtered by its event range
+ 
+ ### Context Window Management
+ 
+ - **No separate context windows**: All agents share the same LLM and EventStream
+ - **Event range filtering**: Each agent&#39;s view is limited by &#96;start_id&#96;/&#96;end_id&#96;
+ - **Condensation**: History is condensed to fit within context limits
+ - **View caching**: The State object caches filtered views for performance

## Summary

### 1. File System Handling
- Agents interact with files through a Runtime abstraction layer
- File operations (`FileReadAction`, `FileEditAction`, `FileWriteAction`) flow through the EventStream to the Runtime
- Path resolution includes security checks to prevent directory traversal
- Files are accessed within a sandboxed workspace with permission validation

### 2. Tool Call Structure
- Tools are defined as `ChatCompletionToolParam` objects (LiteLLM format)
- LLM responses with tool calls are parsed by `response_to_actions()` in `function_calling.py`
- Each tool call is converted to an OpenHands `Action` object
- Tools are included in the system message sent to the LLM

### 3. Looping Strategy
- Parent-delegate pattern: main agents can spawn sub-agents via `AgentDelegateAction`
- Delegates share the same `EventStream` but have separate `State` objects
- Parent forwards events to active delegates
- Delegates have their own `start_id`/`end_id` ranges to filter their view of history
- When delegates finish, parent resumes control and receives results via `AgentDelegateObservation`

### 4. Context Windows
- Sub-agents do not have separate context windows
- They share the same `EventStream` and `LLMRegistry`
- Each agent's view is filtered by its `State`'s `start_id`/`end_id` range
- The conversation memory and condenser operate on each agent's filtered history
- Metrics are tracked globally but can be computed locally via snapshots

### 5. Replication Guide
The document includes a guide on how to replicate agents, including:
- Inheriting from the `Agent` base class
- Implementing the `step()` method
- Registering agents in the registry
- Example implementation from `CodeActAgent`
